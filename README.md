https://roadmap.sh/projects/age-calculator
The goal of this project is to help you learn about how to use external packages using npm. The user inputs their birthdate via a JavaScript Datepicker, and the app calculates and displays their exact age, including years, and months using Luxon.

You are required to develop an age calculator with the following features:
A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (avoid the default HTML date picker)
Use the Luxon library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
Implement basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
Use simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive
